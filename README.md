# Bappo Realm Bot

The Bappo Realm Bot, as you can imagine, is for the [Bappo Realm discord server](https://discord.gg/E2d8WM3 "The Discord Server"), with it right now mainly being used to aid with verification.

Made with [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py "Github link"), one of my personal favorite Discord API wrappers, and hosted on [Red Hat OpenShift Online](https://www.openshift.com/ "OpenShift Website") (which is why .s2i exists).

Made by Sonic4999, better known as SonicTBM on the server.
